# BaseballLeaderboard

BaseballLeaderboard is an interface to [baseball-reference.com's](https://www.baseball-reference.com/) leaderboard feature. This app takes input from the user in the form of a question. With that question, the app will scrape the leaderboard page of baseball-reference.com and return the top result. (e.g. "What pitcher has the lowest ERA?" --> returns "Name: Jacob DeGrom -- Team: New York Mets -- ERA: 1.76")
